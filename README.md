# Full Stack course GraphQL exercises
Here are the front- and backends of a simple example web app using GraphQL for data management. The fron- and backend are in their own folders.

In these exercises I practiced using GitHub Copilot. I started using it midway through and didn't generate everything of course, I used the AI tool to autocomplete simple code snippets, not create logic. If this led to me accidentally plagiarising/copy-pasting someone else's code, I'll remove that code.

Almost immediately when using Copilot, it generated code blocks that caused the system to notify me about different repositories, that included the exact same or very similar code. These were repositories of other people who have completed this module of the FS course. I of course deleted or modified these code blocks, but this made me think, that a person could probably completely copy/paste or easily generate the exercises in the FS course by using Copilot, without learning anything or with very minimal effort of their own.

I've realized that using Copilot in these exercises is not beneficial and is too risky in terms of plagiarizing, so I'll stop using it. I used it for a few hours, in I think 1/5 - 2/5 of the exercises.
